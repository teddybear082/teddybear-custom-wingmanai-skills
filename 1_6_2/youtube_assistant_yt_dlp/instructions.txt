This skill uses yt-dlp.exe and its version of ffmpeg (https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp). You need to download that ffmpeg.exe file and place it in this folder (it's over 100mb so can't be put on GitHub). As a result the skill increases in size and is slower but adds the capability to also retrieve video comments, can download a higher quality video (usually in webp format), can still download audio, and in theory supports other non-youtube video formats.
